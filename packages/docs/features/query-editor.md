# SQL Query Editor

The SQL Query Editor is the heart of Quarry, providing a powerful environment for writing, executing, and managing SQL queries. Built on the Monaco editor (the same editor that powers VS Code), it offers professional-grade features for database developers.

## Opening the Query Editor

The Query Editor is accessible from the main workspace:

1. Click the **Query** tab in the main content area, or
2. Press <kbd>Cmd/Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>E</kbd> to focus the editor

## Writing SQL Queries

### Syntax Highlighting

Quarry provides rich syntax highlighting for SQL:

- **Keywords** - `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, etc. are highlighted
- **Strings** - Text in quotes is color-coded
- **Numbers** - Numeric values stand out
- **Comments** - Both `--` and `/* */` style comments are supported

```sql
-- Example query with syntax highlighting
SELECT
    u.name,
    u.email,
    COUNT(o.id) as order_count
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id
WHERE u.created_at > '2024-01-01'
GROUP BY u.id
HAVING order_count > 5
ORDER BY order_count DESC;
```

### Intelligent Autocomplete

As you type, Quarry suggests:

- **Table names** from your database schema
- **Column names** for the tables in your query
- **SQL keywords** and functions
- **Common SQL patterns**

::: tip Triggering Autocomplete
Autocomplete appears automatically as you type. You can also press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Space</kbd> to manually trigger suggestions.
:::

The autocomplete system is **context-aware**:

- After `FROM` or `JOIN`, it suggests table names
- After a table alias or dot (`.`), it suggests column names
- It adapts to your database schema automatically

### SQL Hover Documentation

Hover over SQL keywords to see documentation and usage examples. This is helpful when you need a quick reminder about SQL syntax.

### Find and Replace

Use the built-in find and replace functionality:

- <kbd>Cmd/Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>F</kbd> - Find in editor
- <kbd>Cmd/Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>H</kbd> - Find and replace

Features include:

- Case-sensitive search
- Regular expression support
- Replace single or all occurrences

## Executing Queries

### Running a Query

Execute your query using one of these methods:

1. **Click Execute** - Click the **Execute** button (▶️) in the toolbar
2. **Keyboard shortcut** - Press <kbd>Cmd/Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd>

### Multiple Queries

You can write multiple queries in the editor:

```sql
-- Query 1: Get all users
SELECT * FROM users;

-- Query 2: Count active users
SELECT COUNT(*) as active_users
FROM users
WHERE status = 'active';
```

To execute a specific query:

1. Place your cursor anywhere within the query you want to run
2. Press <kbd>Cmd/Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd>

Quarry executes only the query under your cursor.

### Query Results

After execution, results appear below the editor with:

- **Row count** - Number of rows returned
- **Execution time** - How long the query took (in milliseconds)
- **Last Insert ID** - For INSERT queries, the ID of the inserted row
- **Data grid** - Full results with sortable columns

</picture>

::: warning Large Result Sets
For queries returning many rows, consider using `LIMIT` to control result size:

```sql
SELECT * FROM large_table LIMIT 1000;
```

:::

### Error Handling

When a query fails, Quarry displays:

- Clear error message from SQLite
- Query that caused the error
- Failed status in query history

This helps you quickly identify and fix issues.

## SQL Formatting

Keep your SQL clean and readable with automatic formatting:

- Press <kbd>Cmd/Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>F</kbd> to format your SQL

Before formatting:

```sql
select u.name,u.email,count(o.id) as orders from users u left join orders o on u.id=o.user_id where u.status='active' group by u.id order by orders desc
```

After formatting:

```sql
SELECT
    u.name,
    u.email,
    COUNT(o.id) AS orders
FROM
    users u
    LEFT JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id
WHERE
    u.status = 'active'
GROUP BY
    u.id
ORDER BY
    orders DESC
```

## Vim Mode

- **Dark mode** - Dark background with light text
- **System** - Follows your OS preference

Both themes provide optimized syntax highlighting for SQL readability.

## Tips and Best Practices

### Writing Efficient Queries

1. **Use LIMIT** for large tables during exploration
2. **Select specific columns** instead of `SELECT *`
3. **Add indexes** on frequently queried columns
4. **Use EXPLAIN** to understand query execution

### Organizing Your Workflow

1. **Use tabs** to keep related queries together
2. **Save templates** for frequently used query patterns
3. **Check history** to find previous queries
4. **Format queries** for better readability

### Debugging Queries

1. **Start simple** and build complexity gradually
2. **Check error messages** for specific issues
3. **Use the optimizer** to identify performance problems
4. **Test with LIMIT 1** before running on full dataset
